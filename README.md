## 1. Guessing game

- The guessing game that we are going to implement in python has simple rules.
- First, the program generates a random number between 1 and 99.
- Then, it asks the user to guess the number.
- If the user enters a number less than the number generated by the system, the system tells the user that the guess is low. It then asks the user to guess the number again.
- If the number entered by the user is greater than the system-generated number, the system tells the user that guessed number is larger. It then asks the user to guess the number again.
- If the user guesses the number correctly, the system informs to the user and the game ends.
